Deterministic automaton
=======================

Your program should read a finite-state automaton (without weights)
from the standard input. First, the program should check whether the
automaton is deterministic. If not, the message "NON-DETERMINISTIC"
should be printed.

If the automaton is deterministic, you should read all the lines from
the file given as the argument. If a string is accepted by the
automaton, write "YES", a space and a given string, otherwise â€” "NO",
a space and a given string.

Your program does not have to check whether the text read from the
input is a correct description of an automaton. You can assume that
there are no epsilon-transitions in the automaton.

This task is only for Erasmus students.
