An upper-case letter and two digits
===================================

[Your program should read lines from the standard input and check each
 line separately (without end-of-line character). Please use regular
 expressions as much as possible (in particular, try not to use
 logical operators outside the regeular expression). If it is
 possible, use just one regular expression.]

For each string from the standard input, check whether if contains a
substring composed of an upper-case letter and 2 digits. Write "true"/"false"
on the standard output accordingly.
