One vowel
=========

[Your program should read lines from the standard input and check each
 line separately (without end-of-line character). Please use regular
 expressions as much as possible (in particular, try not to use
 logical operators outside the regeular expression). If it is
 possible, use just one regular expression.]

For each string from the standard input, check whether it is a single
word with exactly one vowel (consider only Latin alphabet). Write
"true"/"false" on the standard output accordingly.
